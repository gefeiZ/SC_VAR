# SC-VAR

Here we report a human variants interpreter, named SC-VAR. 


# What can sc-var do?

This tool can interpret disease-related risks with whole genome wide (including both coding and non-coding regions) variants from GWAS studies and single-cell data on four layers: risk CREs,risk genes, gene sets, and cell types.




# How to install?

pip install sc-var

check https://pypi.org/project/sc-var/
